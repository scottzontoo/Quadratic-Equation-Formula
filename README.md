# Quadratic Equation Solver

This repository contains implementations of a quadratic equation solver in various programming languages.

## Files

- `Formula.c`: C implementation of the quadratic equation solver.
- `Formula.cpp`: C++ implementation of the quadratic equation solver.
- `Formula.py`: Python implementation of the quadratic equation solver.
- `formula.java`: Java implementation of the quadratic equation solver.
- `formula.js`: JavaScript implementation of the quadratic equation solver.

## Usage

Each file contains a program that takes coefficients (A, B, and C) of a quadratic equation as input and calculates its roots. The programs then output the negative and positive roots.

To run the programs, simply execute the respective files using the appropriate compiler or interpreter for each language.

### Examples

#### C/C++ Pyhton Java and Javascript
```bash
gcc Formula.c -o Formula
./Formula

python Formula.py

javac formula.java
java formula

node formula.js
